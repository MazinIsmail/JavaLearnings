 * In Java, the design principles are the set of advice used as rules in design
 * making. In Java, the design principles are similar to the design patterns
 * concept. The only difference between the design principle and design pattern
 * is that the design principles are more generalized and abstract. The design
 * pattern contains much more practical advice and concrete. The design patterns
 * are related to the entire class problems, not just generalized coding
 * practices.
 * 
 * SOLID: -
 * 
 * SOLID principles are an object-oriented approach that are applied to software
 * structure design. Robert C. Martin is the one who came up with the idea.
 * 
 * Ensures that the software is modular, easy to understand, debug, and
 * refactor.
 * 
 * 
 * Benefits of using SOLID principles: -
 * 
 * Clean: SOLID principles make code clean and standard code.
 * 
 * Maintainable: with the help of SOLID principles our code becomes more
 * manageable and easy to maintain.
 * 
 * Scalable: Easy to refactor or change code.
 * 
 * Redundancy: SOLID principles avoid redundant code.
 * 
 * Testable: can be easily unit tested.
 * 
 * Readable: SOLID principles make the code easy and readable.
 * 
 * Independent: code becomes independent by reducing dependencies.
 * 
 * Reusable: code becomes reusable.
