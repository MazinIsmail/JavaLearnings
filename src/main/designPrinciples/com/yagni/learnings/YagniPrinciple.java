/**
 * YAGNI Principle
 * 
 * You Aren’t Gonna Need It
 * 
 * It’s sometimes controversial because some developers like to look into the
 * future and make misinformed assumptions about their project.
 * 
 * Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just
 * foresee that you need them.
 * 
 * Even if you are totally sure that you will need a feature or piece of code
 * later on, do not implement it now. Most likely, you will not need it after
 * all or what you actually need is quite different from what you foresaw
 * needing earlier.
 * 
 * Cost of building — All the effort spent on analyzing, programming, and
 * testing a feature.
 * 
 * Cost of delay — The lost opportunity to build and release another feature
 * now.
 * 
 * Cost of carry — The complexity added by the feature to the code, making the
 * software harder to modify and debug.
 * 
 * Cost of repair — The effort spent on modifying a feature because it is not
 * exactly what you need now.
 * 
 * 
 * Find a balance between having some up-front design or using patterns, and
 * being completely strict.
