 * WET Principle: -
 * 
 * Violations of the DRY Principle. WET can be an abbreviation for multiple
 * things:
 * 
 * We Enjoy Typing, Waste Everyone's Time, Write Every Time, Write Everything
 * Twice
 * 
 * WET solutions aren't always bad, as repetition is sometimes advisable in
 * inherently dissimilar classes, or in order to make code more readable, less
 * inter-dependent, etc.
