/**
 * 
 * Single Responsibility Principle
 * 
 * One class should have only one and only responsibility.
 * 
 * According to the single responsibility principle, there should be only one
 * reason due to which a class has to be changed.
 * 
 * When the Single Responsibility Principle is followed, testing is easier. With
 * a single responsibility, the class will have fewer test cases. Less
 * functionality also means fewer dependencies to other classes. It leads to
 * better code organization since smaller and well-purposed classes are easier
 * to search.
