 * The default version of clone() method creates the shallow copy of an object.
 * The shallow copy of an object will have exact copy of all the fields of
 * original object. If original object has any references to other objects as
 * fields, then only references of those objects are copied into clone object,
 * copy of those objects are not created. That means any changes made to those
 * objects through clone object will be reflected in original object or
 * vice-versa.
