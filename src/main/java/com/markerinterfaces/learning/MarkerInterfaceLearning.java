/**
 * A marker interface is an interface that has no methods or constants inside
 * it. It provides run-time type information about objects, so the compiler and
 * JVM have additional information about the object.
 * 
 * A marker interface is also called a tagging interface. Java has many built-in
 * marker interfaces, such as Serializable, Cloneable, and Remote.
