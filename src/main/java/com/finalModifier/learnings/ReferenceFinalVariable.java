/**
 * final means that you can’t change the object’s reference to point to another
 * reference or another object, but you can still mutate its state (using setter
 * methods e.g).
 *
 * By declaring a reference variable as final, we won’t get any immutability
 * nature, Even though reference variable is final. We can perform any type of
 * change in the corresponding Object. But we can't perform reassignment for
 * that variable.
 *
 * final ensures that the address of the object remains the same
