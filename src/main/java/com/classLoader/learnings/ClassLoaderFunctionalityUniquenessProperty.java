 * Uniqueness Property
 * 
 * The Uniquesness Property ensures that the classes are unique and there is no
 * repetition of classes. This also ensures that the classes loaded by parent
 * classloaders are not loaded by the child classloaders. If the parent class
 * loader isn’t able to find the class, only then the current instance would
 * attempt to do so itself.
