 * After the JVM requests for the class, a few steps are to be followed in order
 * to load a class. The Classes are loaded as per the delegation model but there
 * are a few important Methods or Functions that play a vital role in loading a
 * Class.
 * 
 * loadClass(String name, boolean resolve): This method is used to load the
 * classes which are referenced by the JVM. It takes the name of the class as a
 * parameter.
