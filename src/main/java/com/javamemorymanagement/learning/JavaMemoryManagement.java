/**
 * Knowing how memory actually works in Java is important, as it gives you the
 * advantage of writing high-performance and optimized applications that will
 * never ever crash with an OutOfMemoryError. On the other hand, when you find
 * yourself in a bad situation, you will be able to quickly find the memory
 * leak.
 * 
 * We can visualize the memory usage and other useful things with JVisualVM, a
 * tool that comes with the Java JDK. The only thing you have to do is install a
 * plugin named Visual GC, which allows you to see how the memory is actually
 * structured.
 * 
 * Generally, memory is divided into:
 * 
 * Metaspace
 * 
 * Code Cache
 *
