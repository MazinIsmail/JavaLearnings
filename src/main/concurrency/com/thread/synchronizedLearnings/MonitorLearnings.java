/**
 * Monitor
 * 
 * The mechanism that Java uses to support synchronization is the monitor.
 * 
 * Java's monitor supports two kinds of thread synchronization: mutual exclusion
 * and cooperation. Mutual exclusion, which is supported in the Java virtual
 * machine via object locks, enables multiple threads to independently work on
 * shared data without interfering with each other. Cooperation, which is
 * supported in the Java virtual machine via the wait and notify methods of
 * class Object, enables threads to work together towards a common goal.
