/**
 * Increasing Order:-
 * 
 * A sequence of values is said to be in increasing order, if the successive
 * element is greater than the previous one. For example, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 are
 * in increasing order, as every next element is greater than the previous
 * element.
 * 
 * Decreasing Order:-
 * 
 * A sequence of values is said to be in decreasing order, if the successive
 * element is less than the current one. For example, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3, 1 are in
 * decreasing order, as every next element is less than the previous element.
 * 
 * Non-Increasing Order:- A sequence of values is said to be in non-increasing
 * order, if the successive element is less than or equal to its previous
 * element in the sequence. This order occurs when the sequence contains
 * duplicate values. For example, 9, 8, 6, 3, 3, 1 are in non-increasing order,
 * as every next element is less than or equal to (in case of 3) but not greater
 * than any previous element.
 * 
 * Non-Decreasing Order:-
 * 
 * A sequence of values is said to be in non-decreasing order, if the successive
 * element is greater than or equal to its previous element in the sequence.
 * This order occurs when the sequence contains duplicate values. For example,
 * 1, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9 are in non-decreasing order, as every next element is
 * greater than or equal to (in case of 3) but not less than the previous one.
