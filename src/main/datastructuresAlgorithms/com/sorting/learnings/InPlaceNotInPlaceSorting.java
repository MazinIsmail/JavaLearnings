/**
 * In-place Sorting and Not-in-place Sorting
 * 
 * Sorting algorithms may require some extra space for comparison and temporary
 * storage of few data elements. These algorithms do not require any extra space
 * and sorting is said to happen in-place, or for example, within the array
 * itself. This is called in-place sorting. Bubble sort is an example of
 * in-place sorting.
 * 
 * However, in some sorting algorithms, the program requires space which is more
 * than or equal to the elements being sorted. Sorting which uses equal or more
 * space is called not-in-place sorting. Merge-sort is an example of
 * not-in-place sorting.
