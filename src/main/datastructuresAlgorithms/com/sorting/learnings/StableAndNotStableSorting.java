/**
 * Stable and Not Stable Sorting
 * 
 * If a sorting algorithm, after sorting the contents, does not change the
 * sequence of similar content in which they appear, it is called stable
 * sorting.
 * 
 * If a sorting algorithm, after sorting the contents, changes the sequence of
 * similar content in which they appear, it is called unstable sorting.
 * 
 * Check Image: 'stable_sort.jpg' and 'unstable_sort.jpg'
 * 
 * Stability of an algorithm matters when we wish to maintain the sequence of
 * original elements, like in a tuple for example.
