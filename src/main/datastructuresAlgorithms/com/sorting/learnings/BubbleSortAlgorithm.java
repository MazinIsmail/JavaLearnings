/**
 * Bubble Sort Algorithm
 * 
 * Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is
 * comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is
 * compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. This
 * algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case
 * complexity are of ÎŸ(n2) where n is the number of items.
