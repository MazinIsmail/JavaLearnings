/**
 * Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be
 * used efficiently.
 * 
 * Interface: Each data structure has an interface. Interface represents the set
 * of operations that a data structure supports. An interface only provides the
 * list of supported operations, type of parameters they can accept and return
 * type of these operations.
 * 
 * Implementation: Implementation provides the internal representation of a data
 * structure. Implementation also provides the definition of the algorithms used
 * in the operations of the data structure.
 * 
 * Time Complexity:-
 * 
 * Running time or the execution time of operations of data structure must be as
 * small as possible.
 * 
 * Worst Case: This is the scenario where a particular data structure operation
 * takes maximum time it can take. If an operation's worst case time is ƒ(n)
 * then this operation will not take more than ƒ(n) time where ƒ(n) represents
 * function of n.
 * 
 * Average Case: This is the scenario depicting the average execution time of an
 * operation of a data structure. If an operation takes ƒ(n) time in execution,
 * then m operations will take mƒ(n) time.
 * 
 * Best Case: This is the scenario depicting the least possible execution time
 * of an operation of a data structure. If an operation takes ƒ(n) time in
 * execution, then the actual operation may take time as the random number which
 * would be maximum as ƒ(n).
