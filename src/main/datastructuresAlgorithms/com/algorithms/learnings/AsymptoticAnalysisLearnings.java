/**
 * Asymptotic analysis of an algorithm refers to defining the mathematical
 * boundation/framing of its run-time performance. Using asymptotic analysis, we
 * can very well conclude the best case, average case, and worst case scenario
 * of an algorithm.
 * 
 * Asymptotic analysis is input bound i.e., if there's no input to the
 * algorithm, it is concluded to work in a constant time. Other than the "input"
 * all other factors are considered constant.
 * 
 * Asymptotic analysis refers to computing the running time of any operation in
 * mathematical units of computation. For example, the running time of one
 * operation is computed as f(n) and may be for another operation it is computed
 * as g(n2). This means the first operation running time will increase linearly
 * with the increase in n and the running time of the second operation will
 * increase exponentially when n increases.
 * 
 * Usually, the time required by an algorithm falls under three types:-
 * 
 * Best Case: Minimum time required for program execution.
 * 
 * Average Case: Average time required for program execution.
 * 
 * Worst Case: Maximum time required for program execution.
 * 
 * 
 * Asymptotic Notations:-
 * 
 * Following are the commonly used asymptotic notations to calculate the running
 * time complexity of an algorithm.
 * 
 * Ο Notation Ω Notation θ Notation
 * 
 * 
 * Big Oh Notation, Ο
 * 
 * The notation Ο(n) is the formal way to express the upper bound of an
 * algorithm's running time. It measures the worst case time complexity or the
 * longest amount of time an algorithm can possibly take to complete.
 * 
 * Omega Notation, Ω
 * 
 * The notation Ω(n) is the formal way to express the lower bound of an
 * algorithm's running time. It measures the best case time complexity or the
 * best amount of time an algorithm can possibly take to complete.
 * 
 * Theta Notation, θ
 * 
 * The notation θ(n) is the formal way to express both the lower bound and the
 * upper bound of an algorithm's running time.
 * 
 * Common Asymptotic Notations:-
 * 
 * constant − Ο(1)
 * 
 * logarithmic − Ο(log n)
 * 
 * linear − Ο(n)
 * 
 * n log n − Ο(n log n)
 * 
 * quadratic − Ο(n2)
 * 
 * cubic − Ο(n3)
 * 
 * polynomial − nΟ(1)
 * 
 * exponential − 2Ο(n)
